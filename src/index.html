                    If you use Tailwind CSS and you have a lot of custom colors
                    in your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, it can get
                    confusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this tool, you can paste the contents of your entire
                    config file into a textarea and see what colors and color
                    classes you're using. This will help avoid duplicates or
                    near duplicates, and also help you pick a good custom suffix
                    to place a new color properly within the light-to-dark
                    gradient.

                    Click on a color bar to copy its class suffix to your
                    clipboard.
                </p>
                <textarea
                    id="config-input"
                    placeholder="Paste the contents of your tailwind.config.js file here."
