# Tailwind Config Color Spectrum

If you use Tailwind CSS and you have a lot of custom colors in your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, it can get confusing. With this tool, you can paste the contents of your entire config file into a textarea and see what colors and color classes you're using. This will help avoid duplicates or near duplicates, and also help you pick a good custom suffix to place a new color properly within the light-to-dark gradient. You can click on a color bar to copy its class suffix to your clipboard.
